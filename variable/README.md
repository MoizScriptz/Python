### A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).

#### Rules for Python variables:

* A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
* A variable name cannot start with a number
* A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
* Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
* A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.


## Many Values to Multiple Variables
#### Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:

### One Value to Multiple Variables
#### And you can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:

### Unpack a Collection
#### If you have a collection of values in a list, tuple etc. Python allows you to extract the values into variables. This is called unpacking.

### Global Variables
#### Variables that are created outside of a function (as in all of the examples in the previous pages) are known as global variables.

#### Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.

### The global Keyword
#### Normally, when you create a variable inside a function, that variable is local, and can only be used inside that function.

#### To create a global variable inside a function, you can use the global keyword.
