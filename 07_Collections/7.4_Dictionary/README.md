# 📘 Python Dictionary - README

## 🔹 What is a Dictionary?

A **Dictionary** in Python is an **unordered**, **mutable** collection used to store data in **key-value pairs**. Each key is unique and maps to a corresponding value.

---

## 🔹 Dictionary Characteristics

- **Key-Value Structure**: Each element is stored as a pair — `key: value`.
- **Unordered (before Python 3.7)**: From Python 3.7+, dictionaries maintain insertion order.
- **Mutable**: You can change, add, or remove items.
- **Unique Keys**: Keys must be unique and immutable (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples).

---

## 🔹 Creating a Dictionary

- Dictionaries can be created using curly braces `{}` or with the `dict()` constructor.
- Keys are separated from values by a colon `:`, and pairs are separated by commas.

---

## 🔹 Accessing Dictionary Items

- Access values by referencing their keys.
- Use `get()` to safely retrieve values.

## 🔹 Dictionary Methods

| Method          | Description                                             |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `get()`          | Returns the value for a key, or a default if not found |
| `keys()`         | Returns a view of all keys in the dictionary           |
| `values()`       | Returns a view of all values                           |
| `items()`        | Returns a view of all key-value pairs                  |
| `update()`       | Updates the dictionary with key-value pairs            |
| `pop()`          | Removes a key and returns its value                    |
| `popitem()`      | Removes the last inserted item                         |
| `clear()`        | Removes all items from the dictionary                  |
| `copy()`         | Returns a shallow copy                                 |
| `fromkeys()`     | Creates a new dictionary from specified keys and value |
| `setdefault()`   | Returns the value of a key; inserts if not present     |

## 🔹 Modifying Dictionary

- You can add a new key-value pair by assignment.
- Updating existing keys changes their associated values.
- Deletion is done using `del` or `pop()`.

---

## 🔹 Nested Dictionaries

- Dictionaries can contain other dictionaries as values, allowing hierarchical data storage.

## 🔹 Dictionary vs Other Collections

| Feature     | List | Tuple | Set  | Dictionary             |
|-------------|------|-------|------|-------------------------|
| Ordered     | ✅    | ✅     | ❌    | ✅ (Python 3.7+)         |
| Mutable     | ✅    | ❌     | ✅    | ✅                       |
| Key-Value   | ❌    | ❌     | ❌    | ✅                       |
| Indexable   | ✅    | ✅     | ❌    | ✅ (by keys)             |
| Duplicate Keys | ❌ | ❌     | ❌    | ❌ (values can repeat)   |

---

## ✅ Use Cases

- Representing real-world objects with attributes (e.g., user data).
- Storing JSON-like structured data.
- Efficient lookups using keys.
- Dynamic key-based storage and access.

## 🔚 Conclusion

Dictionaries are one of the most powerful and flexible data types in Python. With their key-value structure, they are ideal for managing structured data efficiently and clearly.
